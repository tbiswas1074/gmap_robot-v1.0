# Google map scraper

This app created with Python, Pandas and Openpyxl

#Description:

This project is about open website and scrape data from 
differnt elements from the web page.....
        In this project i made a bot which can get values from
google map search list one by one and extrace the values 
in a excel file in the desktop home Details folder....
Don't need to create any file.<If any error auccord or
file not created in the desktop home create a Folder name
: <Details>

#Technologies:

Python:
>1.selenium==4.1.3
>2.pandas==1.4.2
>3.openpyxl==3.0.9

## Additional Information

If ther is any error like runtime error or time limit
exceed rerun it:
I am using ssd so the run time is little bit faster than normal
HDD.

If no element found or no such element error:
Google map usees dynamic id value or class value 
which canbe changed in future so there is a posibility of 
occuring this problem.
